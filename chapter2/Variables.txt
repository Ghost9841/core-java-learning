//  2.4 Variables and Constants

# Declaring variables

double salary;
int vacationDays;
long earthPopulation;
boolean done;

# Initializing Variables

int vacationDays;
vacationDays = 12;

double salary = 65000.0;
System.out.println(salary);
int vacationDays = 12;

# Constants 

In Java, you use the keyword *final* to denote a constant.

public class Constants {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        final double CM_PER_INCH = 2.54;
        double paperWidth = 8.5;
        double paperHeight = 11;
        // Above is size of A4 paper btw
        System.out.println("Paper size in centimeters: " + paperWidth * CM_PER_INCH + "by" + paperHeight * CM_PER_INCH);
    }
}

Just like Above, it is more common to define a constants as a class like below code

public class Constants {
    public static final double CM_PER_INCH = 2.54;
    public static void main(String[] args){
        double paperWidth = 8.5;
        double paperHeight = 11;
        // Above is size of A4 paper btw
        System.out.println("Paper size in centimeters: " + paperWidth * CM_PER_INCH + "by" + paperHeight * CM_PER_INCH);
    }
}

# Enumerated Types

Sometimes, a variable should only hold a restricted set of values. 
For e.g. a cloth may come in four sizes : small, medium, large and ex tra large.
An enumerated type has a finite number of named values.

enum Size { SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE, EXTRA_LARGE}

Now you can declare variables of this type:
Size s = Size.MEDIUM;
